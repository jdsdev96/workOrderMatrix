# workOrderMatrix
Sorts work orders by importance by plotting the work order on a 3 dimensional grid. We will have a theoretical most important point, we will calculate the distance to that point, and sort closest to furthest. Each dimension will have a multiplier that we can use to deliberately 'boost' a work orders importance if need be.

This is NOT meant to make the weekend work schedule, only advise it.
